I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), being co-advised by Dr. [Madalina Fiterau](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mfiterau/) at the [Information Fusion](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/home/) lab and Dr. [Anna Green](https://sage.cs.umass.edu/author/anna-green/) at the [Sequence Analysis and Genomics (SAGE)](https://sage.cs.umass.edu/) lab.

My research interests are Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Multimodal Models. I am working on applying these techniques to healthcare and computational biology. Specifically, I am a research assistant funded by NIH on early Alzheimer's Disease forecasting and also working on another project about compound permeability prediction for developing tuberculosis antibiotics.

Before came to UMass Amherst, I completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Computational Science and Engineering from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in 2024. I accomplished my master's thesis "Hybrid CNN with Multimodal Data for Early Alzheimer's Disease Forecasting" with the supervision of Dr. [Madalina Fiterau](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mfiterau/) and Dr. [James Percival](https://jrper.github.io/). I obtained a B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology at [China Agricultural University](https://en.cau.edu.cn/) in 2023, and exchanged to the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in 2021 (University and Professional Studies program).
